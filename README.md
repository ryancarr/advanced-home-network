# advanced-home-network
Detailed plans for revamping our home network focusing on advanced MAC filtering and Guest network
## Goals
* A home network set up that provides MAC filtering allowing some devices to be disabled from the network during certain hours of the day.
* DNS filtering to both limit access to certain sites and perhaps filter ads, looking at the abilities of pihole for this.
* Attempt to do this using already owned Small Office/Home Office networking equipment
